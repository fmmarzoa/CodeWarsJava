# CodeWarsJava
Some of my Java solutions for CodeWars challenges.

If you are not familiar with CodeWars these are usually small solutions to specific
challenges that must be fitted in one file, so I'd refactorize some of these if they
were intended to be used in a real world problem, splitting the code along several
classes and files.
